<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Almost every commerce cloud project requires integrations, with Salesforce B2B Commerce that is no different. Up until recently Salesforce has provided a sample heroku server to mock the expected response to their sample adapters. With that sample heroku server being turned off in Sept of 2023, we've build this app for customers & partners alike.</p>
<p>This app is build in NodeJs and is designed to mock responses back to your stores for the integrations in checkout. </p>
